Note: Remember to customize the design and functionality of the landing page as per your requirements. You can create a separate CSS file (style.css) to define the styles for your landing page elements. Additionally, the form in the "Contact" section should be handled by a server-side script (e.g., PHP) that processes the form data and sends it to your desired destination.

Once you have the HTML content ready, you can replace the existing site's index.html or create a new file (e.g., index.html) in the directory specified in the Apache configuration (Step 3 of the previous response).
